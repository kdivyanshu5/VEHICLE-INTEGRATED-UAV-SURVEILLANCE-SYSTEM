# VEHICLE-INTEGRATED-UAV-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) pose security and surveillance challenges, especially in restricted and sensitive zones. Manual monitoring is inefficient and error-prone. Detect UAVs in real time using vision-based techniques.->Integrate surveillance with vehicle-mounted systems.->Provide fast and accurate alerts for security response.
